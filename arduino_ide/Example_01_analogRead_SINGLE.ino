  License: This code is public domain but you buy me a beverage if you use this and we meet someday.
  This code was adapted from the MyoWare analogReadValue.ino example found here:
  https://github.com/AdvancerTechnologies/MyoWare_MuscleSensor

  This example streams the data from a single MyoWare sensor attached to ADC A0.
  Graphical representation is available using Serial Plotter (Tools > Serial Plotter menu).

  *Only run on a laptop using its battery. Do not plug in laptop charger/dock/monitor.
  
  *Do not touch your laptop trackpad or keyboard while the MyoWare sensor is powered.

  Hardware:
  SparkFun RedBoard Artemis (or Arduino of choice)
  USB from Artemis to Computer.
  Output from sensor connected to your Arduino pin A0
  
  This example code is in the public domain.

const int SENSOR_PIN = A0;
const int FULL_SCALE = 1023; // bruk 4095 p√• 12-bit ADC (f.eks. ESP32)

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  while (!Serial) {}
  Serial.println("MyoWare dual print");
}

void loop() {
  int v = analogRead(A0);
  Serial.print(0);
  Serial.print('\t');
  Serial.print(v);
  Serial.print('\t');
  Serial.println(1023);
