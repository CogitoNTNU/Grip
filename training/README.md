# Training

Model training for neural networks and XGBoost.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Structure

- `nn/` - Neural network models (LSTM, CNN, etc.)
- `xgb/` - XGBoost models
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for experiments

## Usage

### Train LSTM

```bash
python nn/lstm/train.py
```

### Train XGBoost

```bash
python xgb/train.py
```

### Experiments

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then open notebooks in `notebooks/`.
